 cout<<"\n\t ABOUT THE GAME OF LIFE\n";

 cout<<"\n The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. ";
 cout<<" It is a 'cellular automaton', and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John   Conway. ";
 cout<<"\n This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. ";
 cout<<" It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. ";
 cout<<" Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game. ";
 cout<<"\n The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.";
 cout<<" One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.";
 cout<<" \nThis is just a simple simulation, made by me, of a piece of art made by John Conway.";

 cout<<"\n The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively).";
 cout<<" Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:";
 cout<<"\n\n 1.	Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.";
 cout<<"\n 2.	Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.";
 cout<<"\n 3.	Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.";
 cout<<"\n 4.	Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.";
 cout<<"\n\n The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.";

 cout<<"\n\n The Size of the Board will always be a square grid of 20 cells.";
 cout<<" One can easily make cells alive at the initiation just by specifying the address of the cell followed by 'y' (For yes) if another cell is to be made alive or by 'n' (For no) if no other cell is to be made alive.";
 cout<<"\n In the following way:";

 cout<<"\n\n (Row Number) (Column Number) ('y' or 'n')";
 cout<<"\n To be noted that all three of them separated by a space and then enter is to be pressed.";

 cout<<"\n 1.   AUTOMATIC                 [Next gen. automatically]                 {'a'}";
 cout<<"\n 2.   MANUAL KEYBOARD CONTROL   [Next gen. after getting any key stroke]  {'k'}";
 cout<<"\n\nThen just sit back and watch your people populate and die as if you are the god.";
