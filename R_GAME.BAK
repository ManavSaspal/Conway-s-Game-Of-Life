 cout<<" It is a 'cellular automaton', and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John   Conway. ";
 cout<<"\n This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. ";
 cout<<" It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. ";
 cout<<" Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game. ";
 cout<<"\n\n The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.";
 cout<<" One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.";

 cout<<"\n\n 1.	Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.";
 cout<<"\n 2.	Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.";
 cout<<"\n 3.	Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.";
